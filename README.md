# xHub

## Description

This is a lightweight script for Roblox Pressure! I only made this since I couldn't find one which wasn't hidden behind some scammy website. This script has features such as fullbright, anti entities, godmode, walkspeed buffs, FOV changes, and much, much more! There is no strict update schedule; I just add features when I have time.

## Installation (Only 3 steps)

1. Open your script executor
2. Copy and paste this: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xBackpack/PressureHub/main/main.lua"))()
3. Execute

Done!

## Upcoming Features

- Auto Interact
- ESP for doors, documents, entities, items, keycards, lockers, and more!
- Transparent Closets
- Auto complete bossfights
- Auto revive
- Unredact all documents
- Fly
- Noclip
- Godmode
- Much, much more! (Due to Pressure's lack of an anticheat)
